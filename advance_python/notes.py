#oops concept: object oriented programing (it allows to break big size program to small size)
#(it helps to write cleaner code and to maintain control over the function)
#(opps work on the principle of class,object,abstraction, encapsulaion, polymorpishm,inheritance)

#what are the advantage of opps
  #modularity:oops allows you to break a large program into smaller which makes it easier to maintain and debug
  #reusabilty:oops allow u to reuse code by creating object and class that can be used in different parts of a pgrm this reduces
              #the amount of code u need to write
  #easy to maintain:that makes code easier to maintain big codes  because its is organised in a modular and reusable way
